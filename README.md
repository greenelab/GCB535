# GCB535
This repository contains the course materials for GCB 535 taught at the
University of Pennsylvania.

## CoCalc 

Computing needs for the course were handled via CoCalc. We used a medium
course plan, and requested disk space upgrades to support the hard drive space
required for the class. If you use CoCalc then make sure that you don't
'assign' items to students until you are absolutely sure they are ready for your
course.

## Setup

Some exercises require setup. For example, code to simulate data used in the
k-means clustering exercise
(26_Machine_Learning_I_assignment/kmeans-population.csv). Code to generate such
files will be found in folders prefixed with the word "SETUP".

## Python Programming Exercises

If you are only interested in the python programming portions, check into
@sarahmid's repository sarahmid/python-for-genomics-miniseries. The exercises in
this course share a common origin with those exercises.

## Data on CoCalc 

For modules that have big data files (e.g. the ChIP-seq modules), it is best to
create two separate assignments in CoCalc: one that contains the data itself and is
never collected by the TAs for grading, and another one that contains the
assignment notebooks and is collected by the TAs. This is because files are
copied whenever assignments are collected and so if an assignment contains large
data files that never change, they will be duplicated for every student in the
class, wasting a lot of space.

## Editing the calendar

If you want to edit the calendar, I recommend [tables
generator](http://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables#). Simply copy the
current calendar into File -> Paste table data. Edit as desired. Then "Generate"
and paste the resulting markdown into the appropriate Calendar file in this
repository.
