    "(1). The motif analysis can be used to validate ChIP-Seq experiment. If you are doing a ChIP-Seq experiment for a transcription factor with known binding motifs, you would expect to identify those motifs enriched in the ChIP-Seq peaks. For example, it is known that transcription factor Foxa2 binds to motif \"GTAAACA\". Then motif analysis of Foxa2 ChIP-Seq experiment should identify \"GTAAACA\" as one of the enriched motif in the peaks. Otherwise, the quality of the ChIP-Seq experiment is problematic and probably need further investigation. Therefore, researchers can use the motif analysis results to validate the ChIP-Seq experiment. If you are interested, See the following reference for an example. Xu, Chenhuan, et al. \"Genome-wide roles of Foxa2 in directing liver specification.\" Journal of molecular cell biology (2012)"

   "source": [
    "(2). The motif analysis can be used to identify novel binding motifs for transcription factors. If you are studing a transcription factor that the binding motif is unknown, you can use motif analysis to identify novel binding motifs. Those novel binding motifs can give useful information about the function of the transcription factor. For example, Bing Ren's group identified a novel binding motif for insulator protein CTCF. By analyzing the new motif, they identified some new functions of this CTCF protein. For reference, you can read this paper, Kim, Tae Hoon, et al. \"Analysis of the vertebrate insulator protein CTCF-binding sites in the human genome.\" Cell 128.6 (2007): 1231-1245."

    "(3). The motif analysis can be used to identify cofactors from the ChIP-Seq experiment. It is common to identify multiple different motifs from the ChIP-Seq experiment. Some of the motifs may belong to transcription factors that are not studied in the ChIP-Seq experiment and those transcription factors are potentially cofactors. Here is a reference for this kind of analysis.  Ding, Jun, et al. \"Systematic discovery of cofactor motifs from ChIP-seq data by SIOMICS.\" Methods 79 (2015): 47-51. "
