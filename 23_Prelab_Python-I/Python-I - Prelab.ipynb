    "\n",
    "You can think of variables as little boxes that we put data in. You name each box so that you can refer to it and use it in your code. This gives your code flexibility, for reasons you will see soon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a variable is sometimes called \"declaring\" or \"defining\" a variable. This basically just requires giving the variable a name and assigning it an initial value. A variable usually needs to be defined in this way before you can use it elsewhere in your code (although there are a few exceptions we'll go over later).\n",

    "geneID = \"Fmr1\"\n",

    "\n",
    "> Important to note:\n",
    "> \n",
    "> You should try not to think of = in Python as the same kind of equals sign you use in math. In math, a = implies equality of the information on either side. In Python, = simply means \"assign the value on the right to the variable on the left\". It may help to think of it more like an arrow pointing to the left, e.g. `geneID <- \"Fmr1\"`.\n",

    "**Rules** (if you break these, you will get errors):\n",
    "   - only letters, numbers, and underscores can be used in a variable name\n",
    "   - the variable name can not begin with a number\n",
    "   - you can not use any of the python reserved words as a variable name \n",
    "   - the capitalization of your variables matters. For example, `geneID` and `geneid` would be considered different variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conventions** (recommended, but not required):\n",
    "   - begin a variable name with a lower case letter\n",
    "   - use a name that is descriptive of the info stored in the variable\n",
    "   - if your variable name is more than one word squished together, use camelCase or under_scores to make it easier to read.\n",
