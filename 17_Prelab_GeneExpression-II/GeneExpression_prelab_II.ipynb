    "As we can see from the histogram or box plots from the previous class, the distribution of intensity values differs across each CEL file. This is problematic, because we want intensity data to be comparable across different arrays (and across treatment conditions). To deal with this issue, we need to _normalize_ the data in some way. As it turns out, there are many ways to normalize data, and many packages exist that implement a wide range of normalization procedures. \n",

    "Now that we have our design matrix in hand, we can now prepare to test our probes for differences in gene expression. To perform this analysis, we will use linear regression to determine if the intensity of the probe is correlated with the effect the treatment (in this case, tissue), and if so, estimate the effect of the probe intensity (β). Because the number of arrays we typically analyze is small, we need to use _moderated_ t-statistics and an empirical Bayes procedure, equivalent to shrinkage of the estimated sample variances of the probe intensities towards a pooled estimate, resulting in better stability for inference (see [Smith 2004](http://www.statsci.org/smyth/pubs/ebayes.pdf) for more details).\n",
