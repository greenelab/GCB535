83534 (of 83534) markers to be included from [ ./plink_lab/hapmap1.map ]
89 individuals read from [ ./plink_lab/hapmap1.ped ] 
89 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9
44 cases, 45 controls and 0 missing
89 males, 0 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
Before frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 83534 SNPs
89 founders and 0 non-founders found
Total genotyping rate in remaining individuals is 0.994427
0 SNPs failed missingness test ( GENO > 1 )
0 SNPs failed frequency test ( MAF < 0 )
After frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 83534 SNPs
After filtering, 44 cases, 45 controls and 0 missing
