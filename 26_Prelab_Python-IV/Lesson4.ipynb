There are actually some subtle (but important) differences between lists and arrays (Python lists are closer to what people usually call a \"linked list\"), but for most purposes they perform the same role. The most obvious difference you might notice is that you don't need to specify ahead of time how large your list will be. This is because the size of the list grows dynamically as you add things to it (it also shrinks automatically as you take things out)."

There are many examples of lookup tables in our everyday lives -- things like a phonebook, the index at the back of a textbook, or (surprise surprise) a regular old dictionary. What these examples have in common is that they allow you to take one piece of information that you already know (a friend's name, a topic, a word) and use it to quickly look up some information that you don't know, but need (a phone number, a page number, a definition).\n",

If you open up this file in a plain text editor, you'll see something like this:\n",

The important point is that on each line, the data belonging to each \"column\" is separated by a consistent delimiter. In this case, the delimiter is a single tab (other common delimiters are commas and spaces). Using the `.split()` function, we can split up each line from this file into its separate \"column\" components so that each piece of information can be used separately. This is often what we mean when we say we're \"parsing\" a data file -- we're breaking it up into meaningful parts.\n",
