    "    import math, random\n",

    "You can give a module an alias and use that in your code (good when module name is long):\n",
    "\n",
    "    import random as rnd\n",
    "    rnd.randint(1,100)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can import individual functions from a module (note that if you do this, you must call the function WITHOUT prefixing it):\n",
    "\n",
    "    from math import log10\n",
    "    log10(100)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can import all functions as above if you use * (so then you can use all functions without prefixing with the module name):\n",
    "\n",
    "    from math import *\n",
    "    sqrt(64)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this last variation is generally not considered to be a good programming practice because it can lead to a lot of confusion in large scripts with many modules in use (someone reading your script who is not familiar with the modules might have a very hard time figuring out where all these functions are coming from!). Use it sparingly, if at all.\n"
