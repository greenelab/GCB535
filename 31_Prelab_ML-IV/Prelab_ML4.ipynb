To make work reproducible, we may want to tell the computer to make up pseudorandom numbers predictably. We can do this by defining an initial state for our random number generator. `sklearn` usually does this through a function parameter called `random_state`. We could re-write the code above to use 42 as the random state. Once we do that (below), running the code will return the same result each time."
