The `for` loop is specialized for cases where you know exactly how many times you want to loop in advance, and makes it very easy to \"loop over\" the elements of almost any iterable object (more on that in a minute). `while` loops, on the other hand, are more general and are better for when you want to loop indefinitely until some condition is met.

The `'r'` indicates that we want to open this file in read mode (as opposed to write mode, which is `'w'` as we'll see in a minute).\n",

We can then do some processing of that line before we move on to the next one, but for now we'll just print it out to keep things simple. The lines of the file will always be read from first to last.\n",

    "**Notes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Although `\\n` is made up of two characters ( \\ and n), when put together they are considered a *single* character by most programming language and text editors.\n",
    "   - When viewing a file in a text editor, the `\\n` characters will usually all be invisible, so you won't see them. However, the editor will use the locations of the `\\n` characters to figure out where the end of each line should be. If you somehow removed all the `\\n` from your original file, your editor would think everything should be on the same line! \n",
    "   - Different operating systems use different line endings. Linux and modern Macs use `\\n`, so this is what you'll see most often. Windows uses `\\r\\n` as the line ending, however, which can cause issues sometimes. \n",
    "   - **Important:** When we use the Python `print` statement, it automatically adds a `\\n` character to the end of whatever we print. That's why every print statement always prints to a separate line!\n",

Then, when we go to print out the line using `print`, the `print` statement adds *another* `\\n` on the end! This is what causes the double spacing – we technically have `\\n\\n` on the end of each string.\n",
