    "The output is similar to one-sample T-test. You can see the name of the test is \"Two Sample t-test\". The t-statistic is \"t = 0.20203\" and the p value is \"p-value = 0.8399\". The alternative hypothesis and 95% confidence interval is also included in the output. Since the p value is relatively large (>0.05) or the 95% confidence interval includes 0, we don't have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis and thus conclude that the true mean of geneA and geneB are the same."
