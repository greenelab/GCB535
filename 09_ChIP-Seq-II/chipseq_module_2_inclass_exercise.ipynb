    "In this class, we are going to apply the ChIP-seq analysis approach we learned about in the first ChIP-seq module to a real dataset. We are going to analyze some p53 ChIP-seq data from a Genome Research paper from 2014, Sammons et al., which comes from Shelley Berger's group here at Penn: http://genome.cshlp.org/content/early/2014/11/12/gr.181883.114.abstract. This experiment consists of ChIP-seq data from the tumor suppressor transcription factor p53 in basal (uninduced) and activated (induced) conditions in IMR90 primary human fibroblasts. Activation is induced using Nutlin-3, a small molecule inhibitor of the interaction between MDM2 and p53, while the basal uninduced condition is just treated with DMSO as a control. We won't be recreating their whole analysis, but we will go through some of the steps of the ChIP-seq analysis. "
