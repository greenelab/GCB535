    "Let's look at an example. The following code is an endless loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "    count = 1\n",

    "\n",
    "So what is going on here? Notice that unlike our other examples so far, we never increment `count` within the loop. Therefore `count` always remains 1, and so the `while` condition is always `True` and we keep looping forever.\n",

    "**Let's see if you can spot an endless loop before it occurs!** For the following examples, guess whether or not the loop will be endless (note that these blocks will **not** be runable to prevent you from freezing up your notebook; see below for the answers)."

    "**Purpose:** Creates a list with the indicated range of integers from `start` to `end-1`. If only one argument is given, this argument is assumed to be the `end` value and the `start` is assumed to be 0, so a list of integers from 0 to `end-1` is created.\n",
