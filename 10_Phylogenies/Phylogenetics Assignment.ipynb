    "MAFFT (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/mafft/) is an online tool for aligning three or more sequences. It works on a set of nucleotide or protein sequences in FASTA format. Remember from the databases lecture that the FASTA format can be used to store multiple sequences. MAFFT takes as input all the sequences you want to align in a single file. Therefore you must first copy and paste your sequences of interest into one file (as specified in the preparatory work for this lab). In this exercise we will analyze the set of Twist gene homologs you generated in the prelab.\n",
