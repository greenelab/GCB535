    "> Surprised by the last two? It's important to note that when you want compare a variable against multiple things, you only compare it to one thing at a time. Although it makes sense in English to say, is x equal to A or B?, in Python you must write: ((x == \"A\") or (x == \"B\")) to accomplish this. The same goes for e.g. ((x > 5) and (x < 10)) and anything along those lines.\n",

    "> So why does the first version give the answer \"yes\"? Basically, anything that isn't `False` or the literal number 0 is considered to be `True` in Python. So when you say '`x == \"A\" or \"B\"`', this evaluates to '`False or True`', which is `True`!"
