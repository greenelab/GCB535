    "If you haven't heard of Unix before, you may be wondering what it is and why we are starting off by teaching it. Unix is a computing environment, similar to the Windows or Apple operating systems, but instead of an environment where you use a mouse to open specific programs and interact with those (such as your internet browser or Powerpoint), you interact with a text-based **terminal**. If you're used to always using a mouse to interact with your computer, this might sound daunting, and you now may be wondering why we're making you do this. Windows and Mac are just fine, you say! Well, they are fine for most types of computing tasks you might want to do, but the fact is that the vast majority of open source software, which means that the underlying code is made readily available and which almost all bioinformatics tools follow, is written on Unix systems and therefore runs best (or oftentimes, only can run) on Unix systems. Not only this, but Unix systems Excel (pun intended) at being able to handle large datasets, which we are all presumably interested in being able to analyze. Instead of having to look at data in your spreadsheet program of choice, learning Unix will give you the power to not only look at but also to manipulate large data sets. And, contrary to what you may think, using a command line for computing is not just for sweaty nerds who dream in green text on black backgrounds; hopefully we will show you that it is actually quite easy to get a hang of!"
