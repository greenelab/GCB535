    "For this in class assignment, we are going to download a compressed data file from the web, decompress it, and then do some searching and processing of the file. I have prepared a simple file that contains analysis of how much each chromosome is covered by 6 different histone modification ChIP-seq data sets in 8 different tissues, all from the Roadmaps epigenomics consortium (http://roadmapepigenomics.org). If this doesn't make any sense to you, don't worry, as the contents of this file aren't as important as learning how to manipulate it! The file is located at http://tesla.pcbi.upenn.edu/~alexaml/roadmap_chromosomal_cov.tar.gz. Similarly to the assignment from the first Unix module, just fill in your Unix commands in the cells containing the '\\$' symbol (don't forget to save when you're done!), and for the written answers, also write in your answers to the appropriate cells.\n",

The 'mark' column describes which kind of histone modification is being analyzed. The 'chr' column describes which chromosome is being looked at.
